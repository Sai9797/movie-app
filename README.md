# :sparkles: Movie Database App React :sparkles:

Movie Database App made with React

## :pushpin: _How does the application work?_

Movie Database application made with React.js.

Training: 

• React - class component with state, stateless function component with Hooks, routing, props, events, JSX

• LocalStorage

You have to create account to add movies to database.

Movies are saved in LocalStorage and are visible for you when you come back to this homepage later.

You can see the description of the movie when you click on the "Read more" button. 

You can only delete movies added by you (and remove them from LocalStorage).

You can sign in and sign out by clicking on "Profile".

Every movie gets a template picture.
